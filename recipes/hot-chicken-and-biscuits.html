    <p>I do not claim this hot chicken and biscuits recipe is authentic but I do claim it is delicious... and spicy!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>2 pounds chicken breast tenderloins</ul>
    <ul>¾ cup whole milk</ul>
    <ul>¼ cup dill pickle juice</ul>    
    <ul>1 (16.3 ounce) package 8-count refrigerated biscuit dough</ul>    
    <ul>3 cups all-purpose flour</ul>   
    <ul>3 eggs</ul>    
    <ul>⅓ cup vegetable oil</ul> 
    <ul>2 tablespoons butter</ul>        
    <ul>1 tablespoon cayenne pepper</ul>        
    <ul>1 tablespoon brown sugar</ul>        
    <ul>1 teaspoon paprika</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon garlic powder</ul>
    <ul>4 cups vegetable oil for frying</ul>
    <ul>salt and ground black pepper to taste</ul>    
    <ul>½ cup dill pickle slices</ul>    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>Place chicken in a large, lidded bowl. Add milk and pickle juice. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours.</ol>
    <ol>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place biscuits 1 inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet.</ol>
    <ol>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 13 minutes. Set aside until ready to use.</ol>
    <ol>Place flour in a large resealable plastic bag. Beat eggs in a shallow dish. Coat a piece of chicken in flour, dip in eggs, and then coat again in flour. Place on a plate and repeat with remaining chicken. Let coated chicken rest for 10 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>Meanwhile, combine 1/3 cup oil, butter, cayenne pepper, paprika, and garlic powder in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook and stir until sugar is dissolved and sauce is heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat</ol>
    <ol>Heat 4 cups oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a large cast iron skillet. Fry chicken in batches for 4 minutes, flip, and cook until golden brown, about 4 minutes more. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels and season with salt and black pepper to taste.</ol>
    <ol>Place fried chicken in a large bowl. Stir sauce in the saucepan and drizzle over the chicken. Serve chicken inside biscuits, topped with pickle slices.</ol>
